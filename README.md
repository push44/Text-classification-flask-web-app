# Stackoverflow text classification web app

## Project Requiremnet

Stakoverflow is an widely used question answeres forum website that helps millions of users worldwide. But because of wide range of user base monitoring quality of the questions posted by the users becomes important. For example, when someone asks a question how to solve data science porblem? it becomes difficult for domain experts to answer the question when sufficient problem description is unavailble. Whereas when somebuddy asks how to solve multiclass text classification problem using logistic regression? it becomes much convenient for experts to answer the question.
In this project we tried to solve a such problem using the data set provided by [Moore](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imoore/60k-stack-overflow-questions-with-quality-rate)
